# zshfish
A theme for zsh that looks like the fish theme. It includes core aspects of the default fish theme such as nice colors, a similar area for return codes, and a change in color indicating if the shell is run in ssh or not.

## Installation
This theme requires zsh to be installed

Clone this repository or download the theme file directly.

If [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) is installed, copy `zshfish.zsh-theme` to `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes` and change `ZSH_THEME` in `~/.zshrc` to `"zshfsh"`

The theme can be immediatly effective upon reloading the shell via `exec -l $SHELL`

## Use
This theme is very similar to the fish theme. The most obvious difference is the timestamp at the far right of the prompt and the use of `Â»` instead of `>`. zshfish has the same git integration as the lukerandall theme. This integration shows when `$PWD` is a git directory and allows the user to see if the local git directory is different from the remote repository.

To feel more like fish, plugins can be added for [syntax highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) and [auto-suggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)

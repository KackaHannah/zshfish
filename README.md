# zshfish
A theme for zsh that looks like the fish theme. It includes core aspects of the default fish theme such as nice colors, a similar area for return codes, and a change in color indicating if the shell is run in ssh or not.

## Installation
This theme requires zsh to be installed

Clone this repository or download the theme file directly.

If [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) is installed, copy `zshfish.zsh-theme` to `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes` and change `ZSH_THEME` in `~/.zshrc` to `"zshfsh"`

The theme can be immediatly effective upon reloading the shell via `exec -l $SHELL`
